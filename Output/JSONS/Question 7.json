Cells break down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen gas with the help of the intracellular enzyme catalase. The optimum pH of catalase is 7.\\n\\nA Biology student measured the activity of catalase by recording the volume of oxygen gas produced from the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide when a catalase suspension was added to it. The catalase suspension was made from ground, raw potato mixed with distilled water. The student performed two tests and graphed the results."
