To investigate the possible beneficial role of this bacterium, scientists designed an experiment as follows.\\n\\nTwo groups of mice were used. The mice in Group 1 had S. __epidermidis__ applied to their skin. The mice in both Group 1 and Group 2 were infected with a pathogenic fungus. The mice were left for several days, and then scientists measured the levels of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and cytotoxic T cells (Tc cells) in the skin of the mice from both groups."}]},{"type":"shortanswer","lines":1,"prompt":"Innate immunity helps protect humans from invading pathogens.\r\nHow does the skin help protect humans from invading pathogens?"},{"type":"shortanswer","lines":1},{"type":"assembly","prompt":false,"marks":[2,1,false],"questions":[{"type":"shortanswer","lines":1,"prompt":"Describe the role of APCs in an immune response."},{"type":"shortanswer","lines":1,"prompt":"In which type of immune response would the Tc cells and APCs play a part?"},{"type":"assembly","prompt":"In addition to the levels of APCs and Tc cells, the growth of the pathogenic fungus was also measured in all of the mice.
